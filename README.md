Offline Signature verification: 
1) Comparison of two signature images using gradient vectors along with method 1 (4 chain code) and method 2 (32 chain code) directions. 
2) The comparison of the gradient vectors is done using Cosine Similarity.

Online Signature verification: 
1) Computation of the similarity between two online signatures using normalized Levenshtein Distance with a different cost. 
2) The values x and y coordinates for the signatures are considered as a input parameter.
